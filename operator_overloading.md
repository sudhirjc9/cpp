# Operator Overloading
- When an operator is overloaded with multiple jobs, it is known as operator overloading.
- It is a way to implement compile time polymorphism.

## Any symbol can be used as a function name if
    1. it is a valid operator in C/CPP language
    2. it is preceded by operator keyword

**You cannot overload `sizeof` and `?::` operator**
